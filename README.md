# GH Demucs GUI

This is a graphical program intended for Guitar Hero charters to split out audio files into guitar, bass, drums, and vocals. It also supports 4 lane drum stemming, and it can rename the files dynamically to the correct layout for Guitar Hero (or similar rhythm games).

# Installation

Installing this program is NOT plug-and-play. It will require some setup on your part to get it to work properly.

[You need Python 3.8 or later](https://python.org/downloads) to run both this program and Demucs. **When you install Python, on the very first screen that appears, check the box labelled "Add Python to PATH".**

To set up everything for use, **run the** `install.bat` **file in the folder FIRST.** Wait for the window to completely finish, and then you can run the `run.bat` file.

**You will need to say Yes (type "Y" or "y") to the uninstall prompt for Torch!** You need that if you want to use CUDA (your graphics card) for splitting audio.
